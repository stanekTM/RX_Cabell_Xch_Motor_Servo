  RC receiver with "Cabell" protocol
  **********************************
  RC receiver from my repository https://github.com/stanekTM/RX_Cabell_8ch_Motor_Servo
  
  Includes nRF24L01+ transceiver and ATmega328P/PB processor for PWM motor control or servo outputs and telemetry.
  
  Works with RC transmitters:
  OpenAVRc      https://github.com/Ingwie/OpenAVRc_Dev
